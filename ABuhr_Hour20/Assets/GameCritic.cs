--- QUESTIONS ---

Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.
    I thinnk that the game is a bit too hard. The main two reasons are that the obstacles move too fast. 
    The other reason is that the player takes time to build up speed when changing directions, making it harder to dodge obstacles.

What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?
    I would slow down the incoming objects and make the player's movement a bit more reactive.

List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.
    I think that syncing the "movement" of the ground and the speed of the incoming objects would be a nice touch. 
    I also think adding in more types of powerups and obstacles would be fun.
    You could also add increasing difficulty as time goes on.

What 2 parts of the game are fun?
    It's fun trying to catch the powerups. 
    It's also fun watching yourself phase through the obstacles.

What 2 parts of the game are tedious?
    Dodging the obstacles is kind of annoying. The lack of change in difficulty and obstacles in also a bit tedious.

--- MODIFIER NOTES ---

Modify the obstacle prefab (Colour, model, anything! The red cube is pretty boring)
    Added a frowny face to the obstacles
Modify the powerup prefab (Rework the particle system component. It doesn't need to be perfect, just have fun with it!)
    Added a lightning trail between the emmitted particles
